## Software Used
For data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and evaluation, we used Jupyter Notebook with Python.
For hypothesis testing, model development, and additional evaluation, we used RStudio with R. Alongside R, the packages "tidyverse" and "caret" need to be installed. 

We all worked with the Mac OS.
